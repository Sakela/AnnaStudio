## Project's Scaffolding
At the core of this project I have used Angular's dependency injection and routing. This provides isolated scopes for each component and avoids globals. Each component has two way data binding with the UI and makes it a dynamic interaction. It inserts certain template of the component based on the routing that is set at the core module's configuration. 
UI/UX design is built with grid system that is responsive to the viewport, and each component has responsive Bootstrap classes and media queries to scale accordingly to the viewport.
